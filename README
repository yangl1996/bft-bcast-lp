To produce MPS file, run python3 problem.py. Then solve the LP described by the
MPS using any compatible LP solver.

MPS does not encode the direction of the optimization. (The python script,
specifically the PuLP library, does output the direction as a comment in the
first line.) The python script generates the MPS file as a minimization problem.
It is important to make sure the solver is configured to perform minimization.
This is the behavior of CLP 1.17.7.
